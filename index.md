In a Node.js application, particularly when using the Express framework, `app.use(helmet());` is a middleware function that helps secure your application by setting various HTTP headers. Helmet is a collection of smaller middleware functions that set security-related HTTP headers to protect your app from some well-known web vulnerabilities.

Here are some of the key features and headers that Helmet can set:

1. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Helps prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by controlling which resources can be loaded.

2. **X-DNS-Prefetch-Control**: Controls browser DNS prefetching, which can help mitigate certain types of attacks.

3. **X-Frame-Options**: Protects against clickjacking by controlling whether your site can be embedded in an iframe.

4. **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents browsers from MIME-sniffing a response away from the declared content type.

5. **Strict-Transport-Security**: Enforces secure (HTTP over SSL/TLS) connections to the server.

6. **Referrer-Policy**: Controls how much referrer information is passed when navigating from your site.

7. **Feature-Policy**: Allows you to control which features and APIs can be used in the browser.

To use Helmet in your Express application, you would typically install it via npm and then include it in your app like this:

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const helmet = require("helmet");

const app = express();

// Use Helmet to secure your Express app
app.use(helmet());

// Your routes and other middleware here

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server is running on port 3000");
});
```

By using `app.use(helmet());`, you enhance the security of your application with minimal effort, making it a best practice for Express applications.
